Planets fact site is one of harder challenges of frontendmentor, really beautiful and fun project.
Data is fetched with local JSON file, I tried my best to create pixel perfect website 
following figma design, used React Router and state management for fetching different parts of data,
made website responsive for all screens and learnt new and good way of adding hamburger menus.
Used themeprovider for providing each planet page/component with different colors, using useLocation.

Also, I learnt not to forget to almost always make website name/logo a link that returns 
user to home page, because when I showed this project to my friend, he clicked title multiple times 
and asked why it didn't take him to home page...
